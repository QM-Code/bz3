# src/game/README.md

This subtree contains the **BZ3 game** built on top of the Karma engine.
It is game-specific: tanks, HUD, radar, net protocol, and gameplay rules.

If you need engine-level behavior, go to `src/engine/`.

## How to talk to an agent
Examples:

- “Please work on the game network protocol. Read `src/game/net/README.md` and
  `src/game/protos/README.md`.”
- “We’re updating the HUD. Start with `src/game/ui/README.md`.”

## Next steps
- `src/game/AGENTS.md` for detailed orientation
- `src/game/architecture.md` for system-wide flow
