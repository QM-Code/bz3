# TODO

- Consider renderer backend abstraction to allow swapping 3D renderers.
- Consider asset/world loading abstraction for file/zipped/remote sources.
- Consider input mapping improvements (actions/contexts, controller support) as a separate module.
- Consider plugin system boundary to isolate plugin loading/runtime.
- Consider runtime data/asset resolution abstraction to reduce coupling.
- Consider UI ↔ renderer service boundary for offscreen targets/texture handles.
