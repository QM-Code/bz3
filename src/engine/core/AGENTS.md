# src/engine/core/AGENTS.md

Read `src/engine/AGENTS.md` first.
This directory holds **shared core types** used across engine subsystems.

Expect small utility typedefs and common structures used by renderer, physics,
and other modules.

If you add a type here, it should be widely reusable and not game-specific.
